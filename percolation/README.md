JS/TS Implementation of Weighted Quick Union Find algorithm.
Original can be found at https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/WeightedQuickUnionUF.java.html
Also original specification of the to be done implementation of the algorithm on the Percolation problem can be found here: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php

Project goals: Just a small ADHD sideproject, rewriting the algorithm from Java to JS/Typescript on a Node project.then(project => project.add(Frontend && Visualization)) :wink:

Backend should be simple enough after it works according to the specification. Some simple Node JS router for the frontend and then frontend is to be done with React JS. Prolly nothing complicated, state should be simple enough. Let's see

DISCLAIMER: did not write the original algorithm or datastructure, only rewritten on typescript
