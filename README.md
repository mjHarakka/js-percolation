JS Implementation of Weighted Quick Union Find algorithm.
Original can be found at https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/WeightedQuickUnionUF.java.html
Also original implementation of the algorithm on the Percolation problem can be found here: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php

Project goals: Just a small ADD sideproject, rewriting the algorithm from Java to JS/Typescript on a Node project.then(project => project.add(Frontend && Visualization)) :)
