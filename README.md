JS/TS Implementation of Weighted Quick Union Find algorithm.
Original can be found at https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/WeightedQuickUnionUF.java.html
Also original specification of the to be done implementation of the algorithm on the Percolation problem can be found here: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php

I have implemented the algorithm to handle the percolation problem with JS/Typescript and refactored it into functional components for the front-end. Current working version is at: https://playful-tiramisu-4ad60b.netlify.app/

## To Do 

- Monte Carlo simulation, never done one before so should be interesting trip. 
- Visualizations on the data from the simulations
- more interactive front-end that accepts user inputs to for example choose the size of the grid or parameters for the simulation
- Minesweeper game or something similar forked from this?
- Could it be possible to easily add the feature of showing different connected nodegroups by different colors.
